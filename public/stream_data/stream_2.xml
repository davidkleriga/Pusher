    <title>The Declaration of Independence begins with a preamble under the heading "The Unanimous Delaration of the Thirteen States of America" and continues, " When in the Course of human events, It becomes necessary for one people to disolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth,  the separate but equal station to which the laws of Nature and Nature's God...," the Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible, "...entitle them, a decent respect to the opinion of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."
Said preamble needs now, in our time manning our ship of state, to be ammended by inserting desperately needed sentiments after the words "... It becomes necessary for one people to disolve the political bands which have connected them with another...," to read as follows, '...as when intolerable ideological beliefs - so defined based on the actions of adherents to said ideological beliefs be they religious tenets or not - have defined themself as the enemy of the Liberty with which all men have been endowed by their Creator, the Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible."
Case in point: the murderous cult of Islam has. Throughout its history Islam has openly advanced doctrines espousing world domination and the subjegation of, that is to say the 'dhimmitudinization' of, all non-Muslims.
'We the People' must recognize and rightly address that the principles embraced and expounded in the orthodox teachings of Islam are evil and incompatible with any freedom loving society.
The murderous cult of Islam is a religious system, but also an economic system, a military strategic doctrine, a legal system (Sharia), a political ideology, an oppressive cultural mandate on all societal institutions and should not be tolerated in the United States.
It was the contention of the Signers of The Declaration of Independence in recognizing the entitlement of separate and equal station availed by the laws of Nature and Nature's God, the Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible, unto a free nation that any such nation's citizens should rightly exercise the action of decently respecting the opinions of mankind in the Course of human events by declaring the causes which should impel them towards separation from, as in the trial of their time, Great Britain.
Americans today should too respect the opinions of mankind in the Course of human events and declare - as we face the trial of our time an enemy every bit as seemingly insurmountable in its challenging magnitude as Great Britain seemed unto our Founding Fathers: the worldwide expansion of the murderous cult of Islam - the causes which now impel us unto the separation from, rejection as legitimate of and exclusion from civil discourse of the murderous cult of Islam and all its adherents and / or advocates.
America must determine to defeat Islam. 
Some argue that there are 'moderate' Muslims, but there is no 'moderate' Islam. To permit Islam to flourish within any society is an invitation by said society for the disease like viral spread of Islam. Islam is a murderous cult which openly pronounces its world domination agenda and aspirations of a one world Caliphate.
Holding truths which are self-evident, as did our Founding Fathers, rejects the toleration of any encroachment upon those truths by malevolent ideologies which deny the Creator, the Lord Jesus Christ, recognized and revered in America's founding documents from Whom all men are endowed with certain unalienable Rights. (That same Creator deleted multiple times from quotations from the Declaration of Independence by the criminal usurper to the office of the president of the United States of America, Mr. Barack 'King Hussein' Obama Jr., the 'Manchurian' Muslim from Mombasa.)
The truth that '...all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,  that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness' rings familiar and true in the hearts of all those who would call themselves Americans. Those words, a tintinnabulation resounding for generations within the very soul of 'We the People,' of the United States of America, echoe the very Spirit of 1776 - the Spirit of Liberty, the Holy Pneuma of God, the Creator, the Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible.
That American Spirit, revered and saluted symbolically in America's Liberty Bell - though cracked and silent - ring loudly in the hearts of all who assent to the truth that all men are, in fact, endowed by their Creator, the Lord Jesus Christ of the Bible, with Liberty.
The Declaration of Independence continues, 'That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from consent of the governed, - that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right fo the People to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their  Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light or transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. BUT WHEN A LONG TRAIN OF ABUSES AND USURPATIONS, PUSUING INVARIABLY THE SAME OBJECT EVINCES A DESIGN TO REDUCE THEM UNDER ABSOLUTE DESPOTISM,..." AS IN THE PRESENT SITUATION UNDER THE ILLEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF THE CRIMINAL ILLEGALLY OCCUPYING THE PRESIDENCY, "...IT IS THEIR RIGHT, IT IS THEIR DUTY, TO THROW OFF SUCH GOVERNMENT AND TO PROVIDE NEW GUARDS FOR THEIR FUTURE SECURITY."
Herein is proposed the formation of New guards against the toleration of the murderous cult of Islam.
"Freedom of Religion!" the undiscerning cries.
The freedom of religion determined by and for 'We the People' in the First Amendment to the Constitution needs not be extended unto adherents to the murderous cult of Islam. The words '...a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object...' define Islam's multi-faceted strategy, that is to say 'design,' of military jihad, legal jihad (sharia), political jihad, religious jihad, economic jihad, educational jihad, etc. 
Islam, as well as the agent of Islam practicing taqqiya illegally occupying the Oval Office, advances an invariable pursuit of an object: namely, a one-world Caliphate and evinces a design, the  strategy of dhimmitude, to relegate America unto the absolute despotism of the status of dhimmi.  
It is our right, our duty, to throw off the illegitimate administration of Mr. Barack Obama and to throw out of our country - this land of the free - adherents to the murderous cult of Islam who in any way, shape or form promote jihad of any stripe. It is as much our right, our duty, to throw off the government of the criminal in the White House as it would be to throw off any such government that would arise which might so clearly meet the description of a government as that which our Founding Fathers attempted to give us warning.
It is the right and duty of those who would defend the Constitution and American Liberty founded upon the Rock of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Creator, to exclude adherents to the murderous cult of Islam from the religious freedoms purchased with the Blood of Jesus Christ and the blood, toil and treasure of American patriots. Islam is far more than a religion and the doctrines and tenets of its political ideologies, cultural mandates, economic principles, legal sytem of Sharia, military regulations, etc..., additional to its religious dimension prohibit Americans from rationally tolerating the murderous cult as a welcomed element within the fabric of American society.
America must expel all Muslims who embrace jihad of any stripe. Political jihad, religious jihad, economic jihad, military jihad, etc....
If Americans do not take the drastic steps now to quash the disease like spread of Islam within her borders future generations of Americans shall suffer the same fate as citizens of many other non-Muslim countries Islam has occupied and/or conquered in its history. Future generations of Americans shall have to take up the fight under far worse conditions wherein the murderous cult lf Islam shall have entrenched itself more deeply and with far greater numbers within our borders. 
The presence of the murderous cult of Islam is an invitation to all the many dimensions of jihad.
No free society should tolerate the multi-faceted dimensions of seige employed by the murderous cult of Islam.   
America must determine to defeat her enemy and demand nothing less than unconditional surrender from Islamic interests. 
America is paralyzed in the fight against Islam by her inability to define her enemy. Islam shall continue to advance on all fronts until such time as America recognizes the murderous cult for what it is and defines it as such. America can not defeat an enemy she is incapable of defining.
History clearly illustrates that compromise with the murderous cult of Islam inevitably leads to subjegation.
We must not tolerate the usurpation of the presidency by a Muslim practicing taqqia. Mr. Obama must be taken into custody and charged for his crimes against 'We the People' of the United States of America.
Impeachment would not suffice. To impeach the imposter one would necessarily need to recognize his legal occupation of the Oval Office which is NOT now and has NEVER been the case for he was illegally elected while fraudulently representing himself as constitutionaly eligible to be president.
 Mr. Obama fraudulently usurped the office of president and, to add further insult to injury, presented 'We the People' with forged documents in a cover-up of incomparable magnitude. Mr. Obama is not the president. He has never been the president. He is a criminal illegally occupying the White House. 
The illegal election of the 'Manchurian' Muslim from Mombasa must be retro-actively abrogated. Everything his illegitimate administration has accomplished complicit in the crime of many centuries - the inconcievable crime of usurping the presidency of the United States of America - must as well be retro-actively abrogated for it was all accomplished in the commission of crimes against 'We the People' and our Constitution.

To permit Mr. Obama's accomplice, Joe Biden, to succeed him in the perpetuation of the crime is ludicris. Mr. Biden would then be put in a position where he could issue an Executive Order pardoning Mr. Obama for the most horrendous crimes committed against the American People in our country's history.

Government officials in Hawaii, administrators at Occidental College, Columbia University and Harvard Law School, Republican and Democrat party officials, and many others complicit in the crimes of Mr. Obama must be brought to justice along with the agent of Islam, Mr. Obama, one way or another.

    <title>Another Enbridge Oil Leak, this time in Grand Marsh, Wisconsin</title>
    <subtitle>July 28 - Breaking News! - Enbridge sprung another leak from a pipeline in Wisconsin Friday July 27th, spilling another 190,000 litres of oil. Does anyone still think it's a good idea  to let this incompetent oil company build the Northern Gateway?

"Enbridge Inc. is busy cleaning up about 1,200 barrels (190,000 litres) of oil that leaked from a pipeline in Wisconsin, and the company has shut down part of its pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to Chicago-area refineries because of the spill.

"Our immediate focus is on keeping our workers and the public safe as we work to remove the oil and clean up the site," said Richard Adams, vice president of U.S. operations at Enbridge.

The company announced late Friday it had contained the spill to a field that is part of the pipeline right-of-way. The incident is a new blow to the Calgary-based firm, which is still facing criticism for a spill that fouled Michigan wetlands two years ago.

Friday's incident isn't the only oil pipeline leak involving an Alberta-based firm this summer. As much as 475,000 litres of light sour crude escaped last month from a Plains Midstream Canada pipeline into a man-made reservoir, Gleniffer Lake, via the Red Deer River in Alberta.

Officials say the cleanup from the rupture near Sundre, Alta., will take months, possibly even to the end of the summer."

www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/07/28/enbridge-wisconsin-spill-pipeline-closed.html

===============================

July 28 - "Canada&#x2019;s Enbridge Inc said an oil spill in Wisconsin had forced it to shut down part of the main pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to US refiners on Friday, a fresh blow for a firm already facing fierce criticism from regulators.

Almost two years to the day after a major spill on a different part of its network, Enbridge shut down Line 14 after a leak that it estimated at around 1,200 barrels of oil.

Enbridge said Line 14 was a 24-inch diameter pipe that was installed in 1998, making it a relatively new line.

The news will not help Enbridge build public trust in its network, which has come under scrutiny following several high-profile incidents, including a spill in Alberta last month and a massive leak in Michigan two years ago.

Just weeks ago, the US National Transportation Safety Board delivered a scathing report of Enbridge&#x2019;s handling of the July 2010 rupture of its Line 6B near Marshall, Michigan, which led to more than 20,000 barrels of crude leaking into the Kalamazoo River. U.S. pipeline regulators fined it $3.7 million for the spill, their largest ever penalty.

The incidents have caused furor just as the company seeks approval for its C$6 billion Northern Gateway pipeline to Canada&#x2019;s West Coast from Alberta amid staunch opposition from environmental groups and native communities that warn against oil spills on land and in coastal waters.

In its report earlier this month, the NTSB said it found a complete breakdown of company safety measures, and that Enbridge employees performed like &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; trying to contain it."

http://dawn.com/2012/07/28/enbridge-suffers-new-oil-leak-shuts-key-pipeline/

===============================

July 10, 2012 - "CALGARY &#x2014; How does Enbridge Inc. maintain trust in its oil pipelines &#x2014; existing and proposed &#x2014; in the face of its embarrassing handling of a major oil spill in Michigan two years ago?

Its extensive investigation into the spill from Line 6B &#x2014; the largest and costliest in the U.S. onshore &#x2014; put the blame squarely on the Canadian company for the disaster, citing a failure to fix known and growing cracks in the 50-year-old pipeline due to corrosion, inadequate training of personnel, deficient integrity-management procedures, and an oil spill response plan that wasn&#x2019;t good enough for a major incident.

Enbridge&#x2019;s response was so poor NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman likened it to the behavior of the &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; &#x2014; referring to the incompetent policemen in silent film comedies of the early 20th Century.

&#x201C;This accident was the result of multiple mistakes and missteps by Enbridge,&#x201D; she said in concluding the investigation. She urged the sector to pursue safety with the same rigour it pursues profit.

To start, the spills won&#x2019;t help Enbridge&#x2019;s cause in British Columbia, where it&#x2019;s already facing big opposition to plans for its proposed $5.5-billion Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the coast. The Michigan experience validates opponents&#x2019; fears &#x2014; that spills happen, that it&#x2019;s hard to respond to them, that extensive damage will occur and fixing it takes time and is expensive.

Indeed, opponents have reason to be even more afraid. If Enbridge stumbled badly in its response to a spill in a populated area, where worried residents called 911 to raise awareness, detecting and fixing a spill in the largely unpopulated and hard-to-reach B.C. could be a lot tougher."

Subject: Passing this on as I received it .. 
Date: Thu, 26 Jul 2012 15:56:11 -0400 

 
 
 

 
I am merely passing this on as received. 
  
Written by a female Obama supporter who voted for him for president. 
  
Legitimate Questions: 
  
This election has me very worried. So many things to consider. I voted for 
Obama. McCain was a Washington insider and we don't need any more of 
them. I have changed my mind three times, since then. I watch all the news 
channels, jumping from one to another. I must say this drives my husband 
crazy. But, I feel if you view CNN, and Fox News, you might get some middle 
ground to work with. I started thinking "where does all the money come from 
for President Obama"? I have four daughters who went to College, and we 
were middle class, and money was tight. We (including my girls) worked hard 
and there were lots of student loans. I started looking into Obama's history 
for my own peace of mind. 
  
Around 1979 Obama started college at Occidental in California . He is very 
open about his two years at Occidental, he tried all kinds of drugs and was 
wasting his time but, even though he had a brilliant mind, did not apply 
himself to his studies. "Barry" (that was the name he used all his life) during 
this time had two roommates, Muhammad Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid, 
both from Pakistan 
  
During the summer of 1981, after his second year in college, he made a "round the world" trip. Stopping to see his mother in Indonesia , next Hyderabad in India , three weeks in Karachi , Pakistan where he stayed with his roommate's family, then off to Africa to visit his 
father's family. 
  
My question - Where did he get the money for this trip? Nether I, nor any one 
of my children would have had money for a trip like this when they were in 
college. When he came back he started school at Columbia University in 
New York. 
  
It is at this time he wants everyone to call him Barack - not Barry. 
Do you know what the tuition is at Columbia ? It's not cheap to say the least. 
My girls asked me; where did he get money for tuition? Student Loans? 
Maybe it's none of my business? 
  
After Columbia , he went to Chicago to work as a Community Organizer for 
$12,000. a year. Why Chicago ? Why not New York ? He was already living 
in New York . By "chance" he met Antoin "Tony" Rezko, born in Aleppo Syria , 
and a real estate developer in Chicago . Rezko has been convicted of fraud 
and bribery several times in the past and in 2011. Rezko, was named 
"Entrepreneur of the Decade" by the Arab-American Business and 
Professional Association". About two years later, Obama entered Harvard Law 
School . Do you have any idea what tuition is for Harvard Law School ? 
Where did he get the money for Law School ? More student loans? 
His family has no money that's for sure. 
  
After Law school, he went back to Chicago . Rezko offered him a job, which he 
turned down. But, he did take a job with Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland. 
Guess what I discovered? They represented "Rezar" which is Rezko's firm. 
Rezko was one of Obama's first major financial contributors when he ran for 
office in Chicago . In 2003, Rezko threw an early fundraiser for Obama which 
Chicago Tribune reporter David Mendelland claims was instrumental in 
providing Obama with "seed money" for his U.S. Senate race. 
  
In 2005, Obama purchased a new home in Kenwoood District of 
Chicago for $1.65 million (less than asking price). With ALL those 
Student Loans - Where did he get the money for this property? On 
the same day Rezko's wife, Rita, purchased the adjoining empty lot 
for full price. The London Times reported that Nadhmi Auchi, an 
Iraqi-born Billionaire loaned Rezko $3.5 million three weeks before 
Obama's new home was purchased. Obama met Nadhmi Auchi many 
times with Rezko. 
  
Now, we have Obama running for President. Valerie Jarrett, was Michele 
Obama's boss. She is now Obama's chief advisor and he does not make any 
major decisions without talking to her first. Where was Jarrett born? Ready 
for this? Shiraz , Iran ! Am I going nuts or is there a pattern here? 
  
On May 10, 2008, The Times reported, Robert Malley advisor to Obama was 
"sacked" after the press found out he was having regular contacts with "Hamas", 
which controls Gaza and is connected with Iran . 
  
This past week, buried in the back part of the papers, Iraqi newspapers reported that during Obama's visit to Iraq , he asked their leaders to do nothing about the war until after he is 
elected, and he will "Take care of things". What the heck does that mean? 
  
Oh, and by the way, remember the college roommates that were born 
in Pakistan ? They are in charge of all those "small" Internet campaign 
contribution for Obama. Where is that money coming from? The poor 
and middle class in this country? Or could it be from the Middle East ? 
  
And the final bit of news. On September 7, 2009, The Washington Times 
posted a verbal slip that was made on "This Week" with George 
Stephanopoulos. Obama on talking about his religion said, "My Muslim faith". 
When questioned, "he made a mistake". Some mistake huh? 
  
All of the above information I got on line. If you would like to check 
it - Wikipedia, encyclopedia, Barack Obama; Tony Rezko; Valerie Jarrett: 
Daily Times - Obama visited Pakistan in 1981; The Washington Times - 
September 7, 2008; The Times May 10, 2008. 
  
Now the BIG question - If I found out all this information on my own, Why 
haven't all of our "intelligent" members of the press been reporting this? Is 
this a Kettle of Fish?? 
  
As Arsenio Hall would say.----"HUMMMMMMM! Does something stink or is 
it my imagination?" These are legitimate questions for our president.

    <subtitle>A bad day gets worse....Obama born in KENYA?

" Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama's then-literary agency, Acton &amp; Dystel, which touts Obama as "born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii." 
 
The booklet, which was distributed to "business colleagues" in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton &amp; Dystel. 
 
It also promotes Obama's anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White--which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.  Here's the copy.  You can check the link to see it:

"Barack Obama, the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, was born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.  The son of an American anthropologist and a Kenyan finance minister, he attended Columbia University and worked as a financial journalist and editor for Business International Corporation.   He served as project coordinator in Harlem for the New York Public Interest Research Group, and was Executive Director of the Developing Communities Project in Chicago&#x2019;s South Side. His commitment to social and racial issues will be evident in his first book, Journeys in Black and White."

    <title>Another Enbridge Oil Leak, this time in Grand Marsh, Wisconsin</title>
    <subtitle>July 28 - Breaking News! - Enbridge sprung another leak from a pipeline in Wisconsin Friday July 27th, spilling another 190,000 litres of oil. Does anyone still think it's a good idea  to let this incompetent oil company build the Northern Gateway?

"Enbridge Inc. is busy cleaning up about 1,200 barrels (190,000 litres) of oil that leaked from a pipeline in Wisconsin, and the company has shut down part of its pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to Chicago-area refineries because of the spill.

"Our immediate focus is on keeping our workers and the public safe as we work to remove the oil and clean up the site," said Richard Adams, vice president of U.S. operations at Enbridge.

The company announced late Friday it had contained the spill to a field that is part of the pipeline right-of-way. The incident is a new blow to the Calgary-based firm, which is still facing criticism for a spill that fouled Michigan wetlands two years ago.

Friday's incident isn't the only oil pipeline leak involving an Alberta-based firm this summer. As much as 475,000 litres of light sour crude escaped last month from a Plains Midstream Canada pipeline into a man-made reservoir, Gleniffer Lake, via the Red Deer River in Alberta.

Officials say the cleanup from the rupture near Sundre, Alta., will take months, possibly even to the end of the summer."

www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/07/28/enbridge-wisconsin-spill-pipeline-closed.html

===============================

July 28 - "Canada&#x2019;s Enbridge Inc said an oil spill in Wisconsin had forced it to shut down part of the main pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to US refiners on Friday, a fresh blow for a firm already facing fierce criticism from regulators.

Almost two years to the day after a major spill on a different part of its network, Enbridge shut down Line 14 after a leak that it estimated at around 1,200 barrels of oil.

Enbridge said Line 14 was a 24-inch diameter pipe that was installed in 1998, making it a relatively new line.

The news will not help Enbridge build public trust in its network, which has come under scrutiny following several high-profile incidents, including a spill in Alberta last month and a massive leak in Michigan two years ago.

Just weeks ago, the US National Transportation Safety Board delivered a scathing report of Enbridge&#x2019;s handling of the July 2010 rupture of its Line 6B near Marshall, Michigan, which led to more than 20,000 barrels of crude leaking into the Kalamazoo River. U.S. pipeline regulators fined it $3.7 million for the spill, their largest ever penalty.

The incidents have caused furor just as the company seeks approval for its C$6 billion Northern Gateway pipeline to Canada&#x2019;s West Coast from Alberta amid staunch opposition from environmental groups and native communities that warn against oil spills on land and in coastal waters.

In its report earlier this month, the NTSB said it found a complete breakdown of company safety measures, and that Enbridge employees performed like &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; trying to contain it."

http://dawn.com/2012/07/28/enbridge-suffers-new-oil-leak-shuts-key-pipeline/

===============================

July 10, 2012 - "CALGARY &#x2014; How does Enbridge Inc. maintain trust in its oil pipelines &#x2014; existing and proposed &#x2014; in the face of its embarrassing handling of a major oil spill in Michigan two years ago?

Its extensive investigation into the spill from Line 6B &#x2014; the largest and costliest in the U.S. onshore &#x2014; put the blame squarely on the Canadian company for the disaster, citing a failure to fix known and growing cracks in the 50-year-old pipeline due to corrosion, inadequate training of personnel, deficient integrity-management procedures, and an oil spill response plan that wasn&#x2019;t good enough for a major incident.

Enbridge&#x2019;s response was so poor NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman likened it to the behavior of the &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; &#x2014; referring to the incompetent policemen in silent film comedies of the early 20th Century.

&#x201C;This accident was the result of multiple mistakes and missteps by Enbridge,&#x201D; she said in concluding the investigation. She urged the sector to pursue safety with the same rigour it pursues profit.

To start, the spills won&#x2019;t help Enbridge&#x2019;s cause in British Columbia, where it&#x2019;s already facing big opposition to plans for its proposed $5.5-billion Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the coast. The Michigan experience validates opponents&#x2019; fears &#x2014; that spills happen, that it&#x2019;s hard to respond to them, that extensive damage will occur and fixing it takes time and is expensive.

Indeed, opponents have reason to be even more afraid. If Enbridge stumbled badly in its response to a spill in a populated area, where worried residents called 911 to raise awareness, detecting and fixing a spill in the largely unpopulated and hard-to-reach B.C. could be a lot tougher."

    <summary>"Salomon Kalou dan Nicolas Anelka hanya bisa memandangi rekannya menikmati makanan karena keduanya memilih tetap melanjutkan puasa," demikian hasil liputan Daily Mail.

Meski dihinggapi rasa lapar, kedua pesepak bola Muslim itu tidak tergoda membatalkan puasa sebab hal itu merupakan sebuah keyakinan yang harus dijalankan sebagai pemeluk ajaran Islam.

Tidak sia-sia pengorbanan Kalou, musim lalu dia sukses mengantarkan the Blues meraih gelar Piala FA dan Liga Champions.</summary>

    <title>2012: Beginning of the End or Why
the World Won't End?
12.22.11
Scenes from the motion picture
"2012." Courtesy Columbia
Pictures. Remember the Y2K
scare? It came and went without
much of a whimper because of
adequate planning and analysis of
the situation. Impressive movie
special effects aside, Dec. 21,
2012, won't be the end of the
world as we know. It will, however,
be another winter solstice.
Much like Y2K, 2012 has been
analyzed and the science of the
end of the Earth thoroughly
studied. Contrary to some of the
common beliefs out there, the
science behind the end of the
world quickly unravels when
pinned down to the 2012 timeline.
Below, NASA Scientists answer
several questions that we're
frequently asked regarding 2012.
Question (Q): Are there any threats
to the Earth in 2012? Many
Internet websites say the world
will end in December 2012.
Answer (A): Nothing bad will
happen to the Earth in 2012. Our
planet has been getting along just
fine for more than 4 billion years,
and credible scientists worldwide
know of no threat associated with
2012.
Q: What is the origin of the
prediction that the world will end
in 2012?
A: The story started with claims
that Nibiru, a supposed planet
discovered by the Sumerians, is
headed toward Earth. This
catastrophe was initially predicted
for May 2003, but when nothing
happened the doomsday date was
moved forward to December 2012.
Then these two fables were linked
to the end of one of the cycles in
the ancient Mayan calendar at the
winter solstice in 2012 -- hence
the predicted doomsday date of
December 21, 2012.
Q: Does the Mayan calendar end
in December 2012?
A: Just as the calendar you have
on your kitchen wall does not
cease to exist after December 31,
the Mayan calendar does not
cease to exist on December 21,
2012. This date is the end of the
Mayan long-count period but then
-- just as your calendar begins
again on January 1 -- another long-
count period begins for the Mayan
calendar.
Q: Could phenomena occur where
planets align in a way that impacts
Earth?
A: There are no planetary
alignments in the next few
decades, Earth will not cross the
galactic plane in 2012, and even if
these alignments were to occur,
their effects on the Earth would
be negligible. Each December the
Earth and sun align with the
approximate center of the Milky
Way Galaxy but that is an annual
event of no consequence.
&#x203A; More about alignment
"There apparently is a great deal of
interest in celestial bodies, and their
locations and trajectories at the end
of the calendar year 2012. Now, I for
one love a good book or movie as
much as the next guy. But the stuff
flying around through cyberspace,
TV and the movies is not based on
science. There is even a fake NASA
news release out there..."
- Don Yeomans, NASA senior
research scientist Q: Is there a
planet or brown dwarf called Nibiru
or Planet X or Eris that is
approaching the Earth and
threatening our planet with
widespread destruction?
A: Nibiru and other stories about
wayward planets are an Internet
hoax. There is no factual basis for
these claims. If Nibiru or Planet X
were real and headed for an
encounter with the Earth in 2012,
astronomers would have been
tracking it for at least the past
decade, and it would be visible by
now to the naked eye. Obviously,
it does not exist. Eris is real, but it
is a dwarf planet similar to Pluto
that will remain in the outer solar
system; the closest it can come to
Earth is about 4 billion miles.
Q: What is the polar shift theory?
Is it true that the earth&#x2019;s crust
does a 180-degree rotation around
the core in a matter of days if not
hours?
A: A reversal in the rotation of
Earth is impossible. There are slow
movements of the continents (for
example Antarctica was near the
equator hundreds of millions of
years ago), but that is irrelevant to
claims of reversal of the rotational
poles. However, many of the
disaster websites pull a bait-and-
switch to fool people. They claim a
relationship between the rotation
and the magnetic polarity of Earth,
which does change irregularly,
with a magnetic reversal taking
place every 400,000 years on
average. As far as we know, such
a magnetic reversal doesn&#x2019;t cause
any harm to life on Earth. A
magnetic reversal is very unlikely
to happen in the next few
millennia, anyway.
&#x203A; More about polar shift
Earth, as seen in the Blue Marble:
Next Generation collection of
images, showing the color of the
planet's surface in high resolution.
This image shows South America
from September 2004. Q: Is the
Earth in danger of being hit by a
meteor in 2012?
A: The Earth has always been
subject to impacts by comets and
asteroids, although big hits are
very rare. The last big impact was
65 million years ago, and that led
to the extinction of the dinosaurs.
Today NASA astronomers are
carrying out a survey called the
Spaceguard Survey to find any
large near-Earth asteroids long
before they hit. We have already
determined that there are no
threatening asteroids as large as
the one that killed the dinosaurs.
All this work is done openly with
the discoveries posted every day
on the NASA NEO Program Office
website, so you can see for
yourself that nothing is predicted
to hit in 2012.
Q: How do NASA scientists feel
about claims of pending
doomsday?
A: For any claims of disaster or
dramatic changes in 2012, where
is the science? Where is the
evidence? There is none, and for
all the fictional assertions, whether
they are made in books, movies,
documentaries or over the
Internet, we cannot change that
simple fact. There is no credible
evidence for any of the assertions
made in support of unusual events
taking place in December 2012.
&#x203A; Why you need not fear a
supernova
&#x203A; About super volcanoes
Q: Is there a danger from giant
solar storms predicted for 2012?
A: Solar activity has a regular
cycle, with peaks approximately
every 11 years. Near these activity
peaks, solar flares can cause some
interruption of satellite
communications, although
engineers are learning how to
build electronics that are protected
against most solar storms. But
there is no special risk associated
with 2012. The next solar
maximum will occur in the
2012-2014 time frame and is
predicted to be an average solar
cycle, no different than previous
cycles throughout history.</title>

    <subtitle>Red Sea Urchins of British Columbia &lt;3

Visually arresting, hazardous to swimmers, and to some cultures delicious, sea urchins are also revealing new information to the scientists who study them.

Here, red sea urchins carpet a kelp forest off British Columbia. The marine invertebrates are important links in the marine food chain. Fish pick at the urchins, which feed on bits of algae.

    <title>Another Enbridge Oil Leak, this time in Grand Marsh, Wisconsin</title>
    <subtitle>July 28 - Breaking News! - Enbridge sprung another leak from a pipeline in Wisconsin Friday July 27th, spilling another 190,000 litres of oil. Does anyone still think it's a good idea  to let this incompetent oil company build the Northern Gateway?

"Enbridge Inc. is busy cleaning up about 1,200 barrels (190,000 litres) of oil that leaked from a pipeline in Wisconsin, and the company has shut down part of its pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to Chicago-area refineries because of the spill.

"Our immediate focus is on keeping our workers and the public safe as we work to remove the oil and clean up the site," said Richard Adams, vice president of U.S. operations at Enbridge.

The company announced late Friday it had contained the spill to a field that is part of the pipeline right-of-way. The incident is a new blow to the Calgary-based firm, which is still facing criticism for a spill that fouled Michigan wetlands two years ago.

Friday's incident isn't the only oil pipeline leak involving an Alberta-based firm this summer. As much as 475,000 litres of light sour crude escaped last month from a Plains Midstream Canada pipeline into a man-made reservoir, Gleniffer Lake, via the Red Deer River in Alberta.

Officials say the cleanup from the rupture near Sundre, Alta., will take months, possibly even to the end of the summer."

===============================

July 28 - "Canada&#x2019;s Enbridge Inc said an oil spill in Wisconsin had forced it to shut down part of the main pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to US refiners on Friday, a fresh blow for a firm already facing fierce criticism from regulators.

Almost two years to the day after a major spill on a different part of its network, Enbridge shut down Line 14 after a leak that it estimated at around 1,200 barrels of oil.

Enbridge said Line 14 was a 24-inch diameter pipe that was installed in 1998, making it a relatively new line.

The news will not help Enbridge build public trust in its network, which has come under scrutiny following several high-profile incidents, including a spill in Alberta last month and a massive leak in Michigan two years ago.

Just weeks ago, the US National Transportation Safety Board delivered a scathing report of Enbridge&#x2019;s handling of the July 2010 rupture of its Line 6B near Marshall, Michigan, which led to more than 20,000 barrels of crude leaking into the Kalamazoo River. U.S. pipeline regulators fined it $3.7 million for the spill, their largest ever penalty.

The incidents have caused furor just as the company seeks approval for its C$6 billion Northern Gateway pipeline to Canada&#x2019;s West Coast from Alberta amid staunch opposition from environmental groups and native communities that warn against oil spills on land and in coastal waters.

In its report earlier this month, the NTSB said it found a complete breakdown of company safety measures, and that Enbridge employees performed like &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; trying to contain it."

===============================

July 10, 2012 - "CALGARY &#x2014; How does Enbridge Inc. maintain trust in its oil pipelines &#x2014; existing and proposed &#x2014; in the face of its embarrassing handling of a major oil spill in Michigan two years ago?

Its extensive investigation into the spill from Line 6B &#x2014; the largest and costliest in the U.S. onshore &#x2014; put the blame squarely on the Canadian company for the disaster, citing a failure to fix known and growing cracks in the 50-year-old pipeline due to corrosion, inadequate training of personnel, deficient integrity-management procedures, and an oil spill response plan that wasn&#x2019;t good enough for a major incident.

Enbridge&#x2019;s response was so poor NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman likened it to the behavior of the &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; &#x2014; referring to the incompetent policemen in silent film comedies of the early 20th Century.

&#x201C;This accident was the result of multiple mistakes and missteps by Enbridge,&#x201D; she said in concluding the investigation. She urged the sector to pursue safety with the same rigour it pursues profit.

To start, the spills won&#x2019;t help Enbridge&#x2019;s cause in British Columbia, where it&#x2019;s already facing big opposition to plans for its proposed $5.5-billion Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the coast. The Michigan experience validates opponents&#x2019; fears &#x2014; that spills happen, that it&#x2019;s hard to respond to them, that extensive damage will occur and fixing it takes time and is expensive.

Indeed, opponents have reason to be even more afraid. If Enbridge stumbled badly in its response to a spill in a populated area, where worried residents called 911 to raise awareness, detecting and fixing a spill in the largely unpopulated and hard-to-reach B.C. could be a lot tougher."

    <subtitle>Bro Showalter and his wife just returned from St Louis attending a deaf conference and stopped in Columbia, MO on the way home to see Bro Cobb. He is in good spirits and has a VERY upbeat attitude. He has placed things totally in God's hands and trusts Him for the best, even if he loses his foot, or leg.

The accident happened when an elderly lady turned into Bro Cobb while she was going into a Walmart. She hit the side of his bike causing him to go down. He has lost most of the muscle in his calf, the ligaments are damaged in his foot, (however, he can move his toes which is a miracle) and there is severe nerve damage which the Dr's aren't too sure that he will ever recover feeling in his foot or leg. He told the lady not to worry that he is trusting God for his help through this.

I admire his GREAT spirit and will say he is representing our God very well with his Christ like attitude.

I took a few photos for everyone to see. He sends his greetings to all ASR riders and wishes he could make the WV rally.</subtitle>

    <subtitle>Today's Landsat week post brings to you: art!

I really don't know how to better describe this wonderful picture. But I will do my very best to try.
While on first sight this could be many things, even biologically grown structures, this shows a river delta. To be exact it's the Yukon River Delta in Alaska and forms the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge. The delta makes up one of the largest in the world

The Yukon river originates in British Columbia, Canada and crosses the Yukon territory, lending its name. Then it crosses the border to Alaska and flows into the Bering sea. When water from the Yukon hits the Bering sea, it is no longer confined to a channel. This decreases the flow energy of the water. Therefore, the water loses some capability to carry sediments. These sediments are being deposited at the mouth of the river, forming the first depositional state of a delta.
Now something interesting happens. The deposition of sediments at the mouth of the river elongates the channel. Yet the change of elevation stays constant. Hence, the slope decreases leaving the path of the river unstable. This leaves two physical options to retain stability. The river can &#x201E;take a shortcut&#x201C; and by that shortens the path and increases the slope. Alternatively, what happens is that the decreased flow decreases the stress on the river bed. Then deposition happens in the river bed, decreasing the depth of the river. Actually this makes it more likely for the river to make the &#x201C;shortcut&#x201D;. Often both channels stay active forming a distributary network. Those are branches of rivers flowing from the main river.
Another thing that happens, is that the river gets in its own way at the mouth. It deposits sediments in the middle of the channel, forcing the water to find ways around the new barrier.

This way the river starts to separate into several branches, forming complex structures. These structures are one part that (for me) make the beauty of this image. It borders to the beauty of a Mandelbrot sets.

Obviously this picture is a so called false-color picture. It is a composite of different wavebands that were combined for this final picture. If you would like to have a look at how these pictures are set up head over to the NASA webpage: http://amplt.de/ld

This picutre placed number 2 on the big vote at NASA &amp; USGS: http://amplt.de/l8

    <title>Mark your calendars for Saturday August 18th.  We will be having an event to benefit the owners of the Cycle Den in Columbia.  As many of you know this amazing shop was recently destroyed by fire.  The owner is devestated and insurance will not fully cover the expense to rebuild.  This is a great opportunity for the biker community to support a local bike shop that has been instrumental to many of us over the years.  Details are still being finalized and I hope to have details out to all of you as soon as I can.</title>

    <subtitle>UNITED NATIONS &#x2013;  U.N. member states have failed to reach agreement on a new treaty to regulate the multibillion-dollar global arms trade.

Some diplomats and treaty supporters blamed the United States for triggering the unraveling of the month-long negotiating conference.

Hopes had been raised that agreement could be reached on a revised treaty text that closed some key loopholes by Friday's deadline for action. But the United States announced Friday morning that it needed more time to consider the proposed treaty -- and Russia and China then also asked for more time.

A bipartisan group of 51 U.S. senators on Thursday had threatened to oppose the global treaty regulating international weapons trade if it falls short in protecting the constitutional right to bear arms.

In a letter to President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the senators expressed serious concerns with the draft treaty that has circulated at the United Nations, saying that it signals an expansion of gun control that would be unacceptable.

The Constitution's Second Amendment offers broad protection for weapons ownership by civilians. As recently as 2008, the Supreme Court affirmed it when it struck down a ban on handguns in the District of Columbia, ruling that individuals have a constitutional right to keep guns for self-defense and other purposes.

The court also has ruled separately that treaty obligations may not infringe on individual constitutional protections and rights within U.S. borders. This goes back at least to a 1920 ruling that a migratory bird treaty with Canada, which prohibited the hunting or capturing of certain birds, was an unconstitutional interference with states' rights under the 10th Amendment.

Treaties are government-to-government agreements and do not subject citizens of one nation to laws of another or to those of an outside body.

Also, the U.N. resolution that authorized drafting of the small arms treaty recognizes the clear-cut right of nations "to regulate internal transfers of arms" and says nothing in the treaty that emerges will affect "constitutional protections on private ownership" of firearms.

Beyond that, there are many court rulings spelling out the limits of treaties. And if an act of Congress is inconsistent with a treaty obligation, the law passed by Congress prevails. Legal scholars say this has been well established.

  The U.N. General Assembly voted in December 2006 to work toward a treaty regulating the growing arms trade, with the U.S. casting a "no" vote. In October 2009, the Obama administration reversed the Bush administration's position and supported an assembly resolution to hold four preparatory meetings and a four-week U.N. conference in 2012 to draft an arms trade treaty.

  The United States insisted that a treaty had to be approved by the consensus of all 193 U.N. member states.

  Ambassador Roberto Garcia Moritan, the conference chairman, said treaty supporters knew "this was going to be difficult to achieve" and there were some delegations that didn't like the draft though "the overwhelming majority in the room did." He added that some countries from the beginning of negotiations had "different views" on a treaty, including Syria, Iran and North Korea.

  Despite the failure to reach agreement, Moritan predicted that "we certainly are going to have a treaty in 2012."

  He said there are several options for moving forward in the General Assembly which will be considered over the summer, before the world body's new session begins in September.

  Britain has taken the lead in pushing for a treaty to reduce the impact of the illicit arms trade.

  Ahead of Friday's meeting, Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg discussed treaty prospects with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in London and told reporters and both urged the treaty's adoption.

  "Global rules govern the sale of everything from bananas to endangered species to weapons of mass destruction, but not guns or grenades," Clegg said. "This anomaly causes untold suffering in conflicts around the world. 1,000 people are killed daily by small arms wielded by terrorists, insurgents and criminal gangs."

  The secretary-general said he was disappointed at the failure to agree on a treaty, calling it "a setback." But he said he was encouraged that states have agreed to continue pursuing a treaty and pledged his "robust" support.

  At the end of the negotiating session, Mexico read a joint statement from more than 90 countries saying they "are determined to secure an Arms Trade Treaty as soon as possible."

    <title>Another Enbridge Oil Leak, this time in Grand Marsh, Wisconsin</title>
    <subtitle>July 28 - Breaking News! - Enbridge sprung another leak from a pipeline in Wisconsin Friday July 27th, spilling another 190,000 litres of oil. Does anyone still think it's a good idea  to let this incompetent oil company build the Northern Gateway?

"Enbridge Inc. is busy cleaning up about 1,200 barrels (190,000 litres) of oil that leaked from a pipeline in Wisconsin, and the company has shut down part of its pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to Chicago-area refineries because of the spill.

"Our immediate focus is on keeping our workers and the public safe as we work to remove the oil and clean up the site," said Richard Adams, vice president of U.S. operations at Enbridge.

The company announced late Friday it had contained the spill to a field that is part of the pipeline right-of-way. The incident is a new blow to the Calgary-based firm, which is still facing criticism for a spill that fouled Michigan wetlands two years ago.

Friday's incident isn't the only oil pipeline leak involving an Alberta-based firm this summer. As much as 475,000 litres of light sour crude escaped last month from a Plains Midstream Canada pipeline into a man-made reservoir, Gleniffer Lake, via the Red Deer River in Alberta.

Officials say the cleanup from the rupture near Sundre, Alta., will take months, possibly even to the end of the summer."

www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/07/28/enbridge-wisconsin-spill-pipeline-closed.html

===============================

July 28 - "Canada&#x2019;s Enbridge Inc said an oil spill in Wisconsin had forced it to shut down part of the main pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to US refiners on Friday, a fresh blow for a firm already facing fierce criticism from regulators.

Almost two years to the day after a major spill on a different part of its network, Enbridge shut down Line 14 after a leak that it estimated at around 1,200 barrels of oil.

Enbridge said Line 14 was a 24-inch diameter pipe that was installed in 1998, making it a relatively new line.

The news will not help Enbridge build public trust in its network, which has come under scrutiny following several high-profile incidents, including a spill in Alberta last month and a massive leak in Michigan two years ago.

Just weeks ago, the US National Transportation Safety Board delivered a scathing report of Enbridge&#x2019;s handling of the July 2010 rupture of its Line 6B near Marshall, Michigan, which led to more than 20,000 barrels of crude leaking into the Kalamazoo River. U.S. pipeline regulators fined it $3.7 million for the spill, their largest ever penalty.

The incidents have caused furor just as the company seeks approval for its C$6 billion Northern Gateway pipeline to Canada&#x2019;s West Coast from Alberta amid staunch opposition from environmental groups and native communities that warn against oil spills on land and in coastal waters.

In its report earlier this month, the NTSB said it found a complete breakdown of company safety measures, and that Enbridge employees performed like &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; trying to contain it."

===============================

July 10, 2012 - "CALGARY &#x2014; How does Enbridge Inc. maintain trust in its oil pipelines &#x2014; existing and proposed &#x2014; in the face of its embarrassing handling of a major oil spill in Michigan two years ago?

Its extensive investigation into the spill from Line 6B &#x2014; the largest and costliest in the U.S. onshore &#x2014; put the blame squarely on the Canadian company for the disaster, citing a failure to fix known and growing cracks in the 50-year-old pipeline due to corrosion, inadequate training of personnel, deficient integrity-management procedures, and an oil spill response plan that wasn&#x2019;t good enough for a major incident.

Enbridge&#x2019;s response was so poor NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman likened it to the behavior of the &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; &#x2014; referring to the incompetent policemen in silent film comedies of the early 20th Century.

&#x201C;This accident was the result of multiple mistakes and missteps by Enbridge,&#x201D; she said in concluding the investigation. She urged the sector to pursue safety with the same rigour it pursues profit.

To start, the spills won&#x2019;t help Enbridge&#x2019;s cause in British Columbia, where it&#x2019;s already facing big opposition to plans for its proposed $5.5-billion Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the coast. The Michigan experience validates opponents&#x2019; fears &#x2014; that spills happen, that it&#x2019;s hard to respond to them, that extensive damage will occur and fixing it takes time and is expensive.

Indeed, opponents have reason to be even more afraid. If Enbridge stumbled badly in its response to a spill in a populated area, where worried residents called 911 to raise awareness, detecting and fixing a spill in the largely unpopulated and hard-to-reach B.C. could be a lot tougher."

    <subtitle>NASA Researchers Discover the Origin of a Major Aspect of Creation of Life


July 27, 2012


Researchers analyzing meteorite fragments that fell on a frozen lake in Canada have developed an explanation for the origin of life's "handedness" &#x2013; why living things only use molecules with specific orientations. The work also gave the strongest evidence to date that liquid water inside an asteroid leads to a strong preference of left-handed over right-handed forms of some common protein amino acids in meteorites. The result makes the search for extraterrestrial life more challenging.

"Our analysis of the amino acids in meteorite fragments from Tagish Lake gave us one possible explanation for why all known life uses only left-handed versions of amino acids to build proteins," said Dr. Daniel Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Glavin is lead author of a paper on this research to be published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science.
In January, 2000, a large meteoroid exploded in the atmosphere over northern British Columbia, Canada, and rained fragments across the frozen surface of Tagish Lake. Because many people witnessed the fireball, pieces were collected within days and kept preserved in their frozen state. This ensured that there was very little contamination from terrestrial life.

"The Tagish Lake meteorite continues to reveal more secrets about the early Solar System the more we investigate it," said Dr. Christopher Herd of the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, a co-author on the paper who provided samples of the Tagish Lake meteorite for the team to analyze. "This latest study gives us a glimpse into the role that water percolating through asteroids must have played in making the left-handed amino acids that are so characteristic of all life on Earth."

    <subtitle>NASA Researchers Discover the Origin of a Major Aspect of Creation of Life


July 27, 2012


Researchers analyzing meteorite fragments that fell on a frozen lake in Canada have developed an explanation for the origin of life's "handedness" &#x2013; why living things only use molecules with specific orientations. The work also gave the strongest evidence to date that liquid water inside an asteroid leads to a strong preference of left-handed over right-handed forms of some common protein amino acids in meteorites. The result makes the search for extraterrestrial life more challenging.

"Our analysis of the amino acids in meteorite fragments from Tagish Lake gave us one possible explanation for why all known life uses only left-handed versions of amino acids to build proteins," said Dr. Daniel Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Glavin is lead author of a paper on this research to be published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science.
In January, 2000, a large meteoroid exploded in the atmosphere over northern British Columbia, Canada, and rained fragments across the frozen surface of Tagish Lake. Because many people witnessed the fireball, pieces were collected within days and kept preserved in their frozen state. This ensured that there was very little contamination from terrestrial life.

"The Tagish Lake meteorite continues to reveal more secrets about the early Solar System the more we investigate it," said Dr. Christopher Herd of the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada, a co-author on the paper who provided samples of the Tagish Lake meteorite for the team to analyze. "This latest study gives us a glimpse into the role that water percolating through asteroids must have played in making the left-handed amino acids that are so characteristic of all life on Earth."

    <title>Taking Back The Charters 
Taking Back The Law

We are out of the habit of contesting the legitimacy of the corporation, or challenging concocted legal doctrines, or denying courts the final say over our economic lives.

For most of this century, citizens skirmished with corporations to stop doing harm, but failed to question the legitimacy of the harmdoers. We do not use the charter and the chartering process to stop corporate harm, or to define the corporation on our terms.

What passes for political debate today is not about control, sovereignty, or the economic democracy which many American revolutionaries thought they were fighting to secure.

Too many organizing campaigns accept the corporation's rules, and wrangle on corporate turf. We lobby congress for limited laws. We have no faith in regulatory agencies, but turn to them for relief. We plead with corporations to be socially responsible, then show them how to increase profits by being a bit less harmful.

How much more strength, time, and hope will we invest in such dead ends?

Today, corporate charters can be gotten easily by filling out a few forms and by paying modest fees.

Legislatures delegate authority to public officeholders to rubber-stamp the administration of charters and the chartering process. The secretary of state and the attorney general are the officials most often involved. Sometimes they are elected; sometimes they are appointed.

In all states, legislatures continue to have the historic and the legal obligation to grant, to amend, and to revoke corporate charters. They are responsible for overseeing corporate activities. But it has been a long time since many legislatures have done what they are supposed to do.

In Illinois, the law reads:

12.50 Grounds for judicial dissolution. A Circuit Court may dissolve a corporation:

in an action by the Attorney General, if it is established that:
the corporation obtained its certificates of incorporation through fraud; or
the corporation has continued to exceed or abuse the authority conferred upon it by law, or has continued to violate the law..
in an action by a shareholder, if it is established that . . . the directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, or are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive or fraudulent; . . . or if it is established that dissolution is reasonably necessary because the business of the corporation can no longer be conducted to the general advantage of its shareholders.
After entering an order of dissolution, "the Court shall direct the winding up and liquidation of the corporation's business and affairs."

In Delaware, Section 284 of the corporation law says that chancery court can revoke the charter of any corporation for "abuse or misuse of its powers, privileges or franchises."

New York requires dissolution when a corporation abuses its powers, or acts "contrary to the public policy of the state . . ." The law calls for a jury trial in charter revocation cases.

The Model Business Corporation Act, first written in 1931 by the committee on corporate laws of the American Bar Association, and revised twice since, is the basis for chartering laws in more than half the states and the District of Columbia. Although strongly protecting corporate property, this model law gives courts full power to liquidate the assets of a corporation if they are "misapplied or wasted."

It requires the secretary of state "from time to time" to list the names of all corporations which have violated their charters along with the facts behind the violations. Decrees of involuntary dissolution can be issued by the secretary of state and by courts.

Corporations chartered in other states are called foreign corporations. Corporations chartered in other nations are called alien corporations. Legislatures allow foreign or alien corporations to go into business in their states through this same chartering process. Either may establish factories or do business after obtaining a state's certificate of authority.

In Illinois, foreign corporations are "subject to the same duties, restrictions, penalties and liabilities now or hereafter imposed upon a domestic corporation of like character."

When we limit our thinking only to existing labor law, or only to existing environmental law, or only to the courts, or only to elections -- or when we abide by corporate agendas -- we abandon our Constitutional claim on the corporate charter and the chartering process.

When we forsake our Constitutional claim, we ignore historic tools we can use to define and to control the corporation. We pass up strategies which can inspire citizens to act. We fail to demand what we know is right.

We must name and stop what harms us. John H. Hunt, a member of the Equal Rights Party, wrote this resolution in 1837:

Whenever a people find themselves suffering under a weight of evils, destructive not only to their happiness, but to their dignity and their virtues; when these evils go on increasing year after year, with accelerating rapidity, and threaten soon to reach that point at which peaceable endurance ceases to be possible; it becomes their solemn duty coolly to search out the causes of their suffering -- to state those causes with plainness -- and to apply a sufficient and a speedy remedy.

His resolution was passed unanimously by cheering mechanics, farmers and working people during a mass rally in a New York City park.

Around the nation, citizens are no less willing -- and are quite well prepared -- to educate, to organize and to agitate.

Citizens who have been to folk schools or labor colleges understand that by learning together and teaching ourselves corporate history, we can hone the skills of citizen sovereignty and power.

We can read our state constitutions. Libraries containing our states' constitutional histories, corporate histories, and corporate case law can provide details about what earlier citizens demanded of corporations, what precedents they established, and which of their legal and organizing methods we can use to our advantage.

We can demand to see the charters of every corporation. We need to know what each charter prohibits, especially if it is an old charter. Armed with our states' rich legal precedents, and with our evidence of corporate misuse or abuse, we can amend or revoke charters and certificates of authority.

When corporations violate our Constitutional guarantees, we can take them to court ourselves. Corporate officers can be forced to give us depositions under oath, just as elected officials who spurned the Constitution were forced to do by the civil rights movement -- often in courtrooms packed with angry citizens.

New Yorkers used to get sufficient and speedy remedy through injunctions against corporations. We can revive this tradition. Surrounded by citizens and their peers, judges can be encouraged to enjoin corporate officials from doing further harm, or from stripping the corporation's assets, or from moving the company away.

Stockholders have authority to seek injunctions and file dissolution suits if they fear managers are acting illegally, oppressively, fraudulently, or are misusing or wasting corporate assets.

As in the first half of the 19th century, would-be or on-going incorporators must be made to ask us for the privilege of a charter. We can set our own criteria: workers must own a significant or majority share of the company; the workforce must have democratic decision-making authority; charters must be renewed annually; corporate officers must prove all corporate harm has ceased. For starters.

Who defines the corporation controls the corporation. We cannot command the modern corporation with laws that require a few days' notice before the corporation leaves town, or with laws that allow the corporation to spew so many toxic parts per million. If we expect to define the corporation using the charters and putting legislators on our civic leash, we must also challenge prevailing judicial doctrines. We cannot let courts stand in the way of our stopping corporate harm.

Legal doctrines are not inevitable or divine. When the liberty and property rights of citizens are at stake, as former Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis said, "the right of property and the liberty of the individual must be remoulded . . . to meet the changing needs of society."

The corporation is an artificial creation, and must not enjoy the protections of the Bill of Rights.

Corporate owners and officers must be liable for harms they cause. No corporation should exist forever. Both business judgment and managerial prerogative must meet the same end as the colonial trading companies' delusion of divine authority.

Our sovereign right to decide what is produced, to own and to organize our work, and to respect the earth is as American as a self-governing peoples' right to vote.

In our democracy, we can shape the nation's economic life any way we want.

    <subtitle>Happy Birthday Kalpana Chawla....

Kalpana Chawla, the famous Indian American astronaut was born in Karnal, Haryana in India on 1 July, 1961. She was a mission specialist on the space shuttle Columbia.

Kalpana Chawla was born to a Hindu family here, to Banarasi Lal Chawla and Sanjyothi. Being the youngest member of the family, she had two sisters, Sunita and Deepa, and a brother, Sanjay. 

She went to Tagore Public School, Karnal and completed Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College at Chandigarh in 1982. She moved to United States of America in 1982 and obtained a MS degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984.

Chawla went to earn a second MS Degree in 1986 and a PhD in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado at Boulder. She became a US citizen in 1990. She began to work for NASA Ames Research Centre as vice president of overset methods, where she did CFD research on Vertical/Short takeoff and landing concepts, Chawla held a Certified Flight Instructor rating for airplanes, gliders and Commercial Pilot licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes, seaplanes and gliders. Kalpana Chawla first flew on the Columbia spacecraft in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robot arm operator. 

Chawla died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster which occurred on 1 February, 2003, when the Space Shuttle disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, with the loss of all the seven members, shortly before it was scheduled to conclude its 28th mission, ST-107. 

Today we remember Kalpana Chawla as an inspiration to many of us and a perfect example to mark the excellence of women in India.

    <summary>We have decided to compete in this race on September 29th instead of going to Oregon. If you are interested in running with us let me know!

The Guts n Glory Dash is a 5k challenge with a guarantee that you'll get a little dirty. Throughout the course you will encounter a barrage of challenging obstacles that require you to jump, climb, crawl and slide your way through.

The event takes place at the Benton County Fairgrounds. And trust me when I say there is nothing "fair" about the grounds, with over 180 acres to chisel out our 5k challenge you may find yourself saying just the opposite...

ALL proceeds of this event will go directly to local nonprofit organizations including, The ARC of Tri-Cities, the Down Syndrome Association of the Mid-Columbia and the Richland Firefighters Community Outreach Program.</summary>

    <title>Had a great day this past Tuesday with my daughters.  Tiffany and I took Stephanie to see the Warped Van Tour in Columbia, Md.  It was a long day for all of us but we had a good time watching all the people and spending girl time together which we have not done in a long time.  The music was loud and not understandable but it was still a good day.</title>

There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.
&#x2014;Eclesiastes 7:20

Thoughts on Today's Verse...
Yep, we're all broken, flawed, and tainted. Or, at least that is what we were (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11). Praise God, because of his grace and the work of Jesus, we can stand before God holy, without blemish, and free from accusation (Col. 1:22).

My Prayer...
Forgiving Father and Holy God, thank you for redeeming me from my mortal and sinful ways by the sacrifice of Jesus. Thank you for empowering me to become more like him by the power of your Holy Spirit. Thank you for making me through grace what I could never be through my own efforts. Thank you, dear God, for saving me from my sin, ransoming me from my guilt, and redeeming me to share in your glory. In Jesus name I praise you. Amen.

There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.
&#x2014;Eclesiastes 7:20

Thoughts on Today's Verse...
Yep, we're all broken, flawed, and tainted. Or, at least that is what we were (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11). Praise God, because of his grace and the work of Jesus, we can stand before God holy, without blemish, and free from accusation (Col. 1:22).

My Prayer...
Forgiving Father and Holy God, thank you for redeeming me from my mortal and sinful ways by the sacrifice of Jesus. Thank you for empowering me to become more like him by the power of your Holy Spirit. Thank you for making me through grace what I could never be through my own efforts. Thank you, dear God, for saving me from my sin, ransoming me from my guilt, and redeeming me to share in your glory. In Jesus name I praise you. Amen.

There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.
&#x2014;Eclesiastes 7:20

Thoughts on Today's Verse...
Yep, we're all broken, flawed, and tainted. Or, at least that is what we were (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11). Praise God, because of his grace and the work of Jesus, we can stand before God holy, without blemish, and free from accusation (Col. 1:22).

My Prayer...
Forgiving Father and Holy God, thank you for redeeming me from my mortal and sinful ways by the sacrifice of Jesus. Thank you for empowering me to become more like him by the power of your Holy Spirit. Thank you for making me through grace what I could never be through my own efforts. Thank you, dear God, for saving me from my sin, ransoming me from my guilt, and redeeming me to share in your glory. In Jesus name I praise you. Amen.

Thoughts on Today's Verse... We get so hung up on externals, appearances, and facades. Jesus cuts to the core of God's concern -- our spiritual heart condition. He wants us to not only focus on what we put in our body, but what we allow to grow in our hearts and simmer in our heads. The inner world is what needs our most earnest attention. So let's be honest and ask if we are spending as much time focusing on our inner world as we are focusing on our external appearance!  My Prayer... O God, who searches minds and hearts, may the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to you. I offer you my inner world to cleanse and redecorate by the sanctifying work of your Holy Spirit. Please guard my heart from evil ambitions and my mind from impure thoughts. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.  Eric Geoffrey Plott Lori Lynn House Kevin Lamount Logan Sandy Knudsen Plott Palm Trees Plott PalmtreesGirls Geoff Plott Towne Plaza Joe Plott Tyler Plott @plot </content>

There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.
&#x2014;Eclesiastes 7:20

Thoughts on Today's Verse...
Yep, we're all broken, flawed, and tainted. Or, at least that is what we were (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11). Praise God, because of his grace and the work of Jesus, we can stand before God holy, without blemish, and free from accusation (Col. 1:22).

My Prayer...
Forgiving Father and Holy God, thank you for redeeming me from my mortal and sinful ways by the sacrifice of Jesus. Thank you for empowering me to become more like him by the power of your Holy Spirit. Thank you for making me through grace what I could never be through my own efforts. Thank you, dear God, for saving me from my sin, ransoming me from my guilt, and redeeming me to share in your glory. In Jesus name I praise you. Amen.

Thoughts on Today's Verse... We get so hung up on externals, appearances, and facades. Jesus cuts to the core of God's concern -- our spiritual heart condition. He wants us to not only focus on what we put in our body, but what we allow to grow in our hearts and simmer in our heads. The inner world is what needs our most earnest attention. So let's be honest and ask if we are spending as much time focusing on our inner world as we are focusing on our external appearance!  My Prayer... O God, who searches minds and hearts, may the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to you. I offer you my inner world to cleanse and redecorate by the sanctifying work of your Holy Spirit. Please guard my heart from evil ambitions and my mind from impure thoughts. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.  Eric Geoffrey Plott Lori Lynn House Kevin Lamount Logan Sandy Knudsen Plott Palm Trees Plott PalmtreesGirls Geoff Plott Towne Plaza Joe Plott Tyler Plott @plot </content>

There is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins.
&#x2014;Eclesiastes 7:20

Thoughts on Today's Verse...
Yep, we're all broken, flawed, and tainted. Or, at least that is what we were (cf. 1 Cor. 6:9-11). Praise God, because of his grace and the work of Jesus, we can stand before God holy, without blemish, and free from accusation (Col. 1:22).

My Prayer...
Forgiving Father and Holy God, thank you for redeeming me from my mortal and sinful ways by the sacrifice of Jesus. Thank you for empowering me to become more like him by the power of your Holy Spirit. Thank you for making me through grace what I could never be through my own efforts. Thank you, dear God, for saving me from my sin, ransoming me from my guilt, and redeeming me to share in your glory. In Jesus name I praise you. Amen.

Thoughts on Today's Verse... We get so hung up on externals, appearances, and facades. Jesus cuts to the core of God's concern -- our spiritual heart condition. He wants us to not only focus on what we put in our body, but what we allow to grow in our hearts and simmer in our heads. The inner world is what needs our most earnest attention. So let's be honest and ask if we are spending as much time focusing on our inner world as we are focusing on our external appearance!  My Prayer... O God, who searches minds and hearts, may the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to you. I offer you my inner world to cleanse and redecorate by the sanctifying work of your Holy Spirit. Please guard my heart from evil ambitions and my mind from impure thoughts. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.  Eric Geoffrey Plott Lori Lynn House Kevin Lamount Logan Sandy Knudsen Plott Palm Trees Plott PalmtreesGirls Geoff Plott Towne Plaza Joe Plott Tyler Plott @plot </content>

    <title>Another Enbridge Oil Leak, this time in Grand Marsh, Wisconsin</title>
    <subtitle>July 28 - Breaking News! - Enbridge sprung another leak from a pipeline in Wisconsin Friday July 27th, spilling another 190,000 litres of oil. Does anyone still think it's a good idea  to let this incompetent oil company build the Northern Gateway?

"Enbridge Inc. is busy cleaning up about 1,200 barrels (190,000 litres) of oil that leaked from a pipeline in Wisconsin, and the company has shut down part of its pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to Chicago-area refineries because of the spill.

"Our immediate focus is on keeping our workers and the public safe as we work to remove the oil and clean up the site," said Richard Adams, vice president of U.S. operations at Enbridge.

The company announced late Friday it had contained the spill to a field that is part of the pipeline right-of-way. The incident is a new blow to the Calgary-based firm, which is still facing criticism for a spill that fouled Michigan wetlands two years ago.

Friday's incident isn't the only oil pipeline leak involving an Alberta-based firm this summer. As much as 475,000 litres of light sour crude escaped last month from a Plains Midstream Canada pipeline into a man-made reservoir, Gleniffer Lake, via the Red Deer River in Alberta.

Officials say the cleanup from the rupture near Sundre, Alta., will take months, possibly even to the end of the summer."

www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2012/07/28/enbridge-wisconsin-spill-pipeline-closed.html

===============================

July 28 - "Canada&#x2019;s Enbridge Inc said an oil spill in Wisconsin had forced it to shut down part of the main pipeline system delivering Canadian crude to US refiners on Friday, a fresh blow for a firm already facing fierce criticism from regulators.

Almost two years to the day after a major spill on a different part of its network, Enbridge shut down Line 14 after a leak that it estimated at around 1,200 barrels of oil.

Enbridge said Line 14 was a 24-inch diameter pipe that was installed in 1998, making it a relatively new line.

The news will not help Enbridge build public trust in its network, which has come under scrutiny following several high-profile incidents, including a spill in Alberta last month and a massive leak in Michigan two years ago.

Just weeks ago, the US National Transportation Safety Board delivered a scathing report of Enbridge&#x2019;s handling of the July 2010 rupture of its Line 6B near Marshall, Michigan, which led to more than 20,000 barrels of crude leaking into the Kalamazoo River. U.S. pipeline regulators fined it $3.7 million for the spill, their largest ever penalty.

The incidents have caused furor just as the company seeks approval for its C$6 billion Northern Gateway pipeline to Canada&#x2019;s West Coast from Alberta amid staunch opposition from environmental groups and native communities that warn against oil spills on land and in coastal waters.

In its report earlier this month, the NTSB said it found a complete breakdown of company safety measures, and that Enbridge employees performed like &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; trying to contain it."

http://dawn.com/2012/07/28/enbridge-suffers-new-oil-leak-shuts-key-pipeline/

===============================

July 10, 2012 - "CALGARY &#x2014; How does Enbridge Inc. maintain trust in its oil pipelines &#x2014; existing and proposed &#x2014; in the face of its embarrassing handling of a major oil spill in Michigan two years ago?

Its extensive investigation into the spill from Line 6B &#x2014; the largest and costliest in the U.S. onshore &#x2014; put the blame squarely on the Canadian company for the disaster, citing a failure to fix known and growing cracks in the 50-year-old pipeline due to corrosion, inadequate training of personnel, deficient integrity-management procedures, and an oil spill response plan that wasn&#x2019;t good enough for a major incident.

Enbridge&#x2019;s response was so poor NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman likened it to the behavior of the &#x201C;Keystone Kops&#x201D; &#x2014; referring to the incompetent policemen in silent film comedies of the early 20th Century.

&#x201C;This accident was the result of multiple mistakes and missteps by Enbridge,&#x201D; she said in concluding the investigation. She urged the sector to pursue safety with the same rigour it pursues profit.

To start, the spills won&#x2019;t help Enbridge&#x2019;s cause in British Columbia, where it&#x2019;s already facing big opposition to plans for its proposed $5.5-billion Northern Gateway pipeline from Alberta to the coast. The Michigan experience validates opponents&#x2019; fears &#x2014; that spills happen, that it&#x2019;s hard to respond to them, that extensive damage will occur and fixing it takes time and is expensive.

Indeed, opponents have reason to be even more afraid. If Enbridge stumbled badly in its response to a spill in a populated area, where worried residents called 911 to raise awareness, detecting and fixing a spill in the largely unpopulated and hard-to-reach B.C. could be a lot tougher."

    <subtitle>DHS gears up for civil unrest prior to presidential elections

The Department of Homeland Security has ordered masses of riot gear equipment to prepare for potential significant domestic riots at the Republican National Convention, Democratic National Convention and next year&#x2019;s presidential inauguration.
The DHS submitted a rushed solicitation to the Federal Business Opportunities site on Wednesday, which is a portal for Federal government procurement requisitions over $25,000. The request gave the potential suppliers only one day to submit their proposals and a 15-day delivery requirement to Alexandria, Virginia.
As the brief explains, &#x201C;the objective of this effort is to procure riot gear to prepare for the 2012 Democratic and Republican National Conventions, the 2013 Presidential Inauguration and other future similar activities.&#x201D;
The total amount ordered is about 150 sets of riot helmets, thigh and groin protectors, hard-shell shin guards and other riot gear.
Specifically, DHS is looking to obtain:
- &#x201C;147 riot helmets&#x201D; with &#x201C;adjustable tactical face shield with liquid seal&#x201D;
- &#x201C;147 sets of upper body and shoulder protection&#x201D;
- &#x201C;152 sets of thigh and groin protection&#x201D;
- &#x201C;147 hard-shell shin guards&#x201D; with &#x201C;substantial protection from flying debris, non-ballistic weapons, and blows to the leg&#x201D; and &#x201C;optimized protective design for severe riot control or tactical situations.&#x201D;
- &#x201C;156 forearm protectors&#x201D;
- &#x201C;147 pairs of tactical gloves&#x201D;
The riot gear will be worn by Federal Protective Service agents who are tasked with protecting property, grounds and buildings owned by the federal government.
The urgency of the order can be explained by the fact that there is a growing anticipation that many demonstrators will travel to the Republican National Convention (RNC), scheduled for August 27-30 in Tampa Bay, Florida, and Democratic National Convention (DNC), planned for September 3-6 in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The RNC itself, for example, will have free speech zones, which will serve as containment quarters for the protesters by not allowing them to leave the designated areas and cause trouble.
Another recent DHS move to gear up was back in March of this year, when it gave the defense contractor ATK a deal to provide the DHS with 450 million .40 caliber hollow-point ammunition over a five year period.
On top of that, the DHS has recently purchased a number of bullet-proof checkpoint booths and hired hundreds of new security guards to protect government buildings.
